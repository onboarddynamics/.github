## About Us

At Onboard Dynamics, we are pioneering the future of renewable energy technology with a focus on natural gas recovery and carbon capture solutions. Our innovative products assist the oil and gas industry in capturing natural gas that would otherwise be vented or flared during routine maintenance through the use of our unique, patented technology. This not only helps our clients avoid fines but also contributes to a more sustainable environment.

We leverage cutting-edge technology to design and build mobile, self-sufficient, engine-driven natural gas compressors. Our systems come equipped with custom controls and telemetry (SCADA) systems that integrate seamlessly with various endpoint APIs. With the help of our partner organizations, our Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) solutions certify net carbon capture data, encrypted on a distributed blockchain network, ensuring transparency, immutability, and integrity.
